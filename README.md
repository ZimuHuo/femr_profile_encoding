The balanced steady-state free precession (bSSFP) is widely used due to its high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) efficiency. However, its signal is strongly dependent on local off-resonance, and so in regions with large B0 field inhomogeneity this results in undesirable banding artifacts. Via linear RF phase cycling, these patterns can be shifted across several acquisitions, which can then be combined to generate band-free images. In each of these bSSFP acquisitions the signal is therefore spatially modulated by both the coil sensitivity and bSSFP spectral profiles. These undesirable banding artifacts can be considered as useful encoding information, offering the potential for greater acceleration factors while maintaining image fidelity. Instead of linear phase cycling, quadratic phase cycling in bSSFP creates alternating equilibrium magnetization, producing to N-periodic bSSFP. This offers a new dimension for parallel imaging reconstruction. In this work, we show how 2-periodic bSSFP acquisitions can outperform linear RF phase cycled bSSFP in parallel imaging applications, allowing for greater acceleration factors.
